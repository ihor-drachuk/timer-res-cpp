# timer-res-cpp

**A small Windows tool that locks the system timer resolution to help with audio glitches, latency spikes, and video stutter.**

A simple app (with a tray icon and optional autostart) plus a command-line version.

> [!WARNING]
> **This is alpha software — it has not been thoroughly tested and may not behave as expected.**
> It changes the system timer resolution and (optionally) adds an autostart entry to your user
> registry. The effect is reversible — choosing **Default** or closing the app restores normal
> behavior. Test it before relying on it.

## What it is

A small, free clone of Lucas Hale's **TimerResolution.exe**. It shows the timer
resolution Windows is currently using and lets you lock it to a finer value.

The app (`timer-res.exe`) is a small window showing Min / Max / Current
resolution, with **Maximum / 1 ms / Default** buttons, a system-tray icon, and a
"Run at Windows startup" checkbox.

Under the hood it uses the same Windows timer APIs (`NtSetTimerResolution`) as the original.

## Why timer resolution?

By default Windows ticks its scheduler timer about every **15.625 ms**. For some
workloads that coarse granularity causes **audio glitches, latency spikes, and
visual "trails" / stutter** in media apps. Locking the timer at **0.5–1 ms** often
makes those problems disappear.

On Windows 10 (2004+) and Windows 11 the timer resolution is **per-process** — it
is released as soon as the program that set it exits. That's why the app stays in
the tray, and why the command-line tool has a `hold` command (a one-shot `set`
does not persist).

## Download

Grab **`timer-res.exe`** from the [latest release](https://github.com/ihor-drachuk/timer-res-cpp/releases/latest)
and run it — no installer, no .NET, nothing else to install. (Prefer to build it
yourself? See [Build](#build).)

> The `.exe` isn't code-signed, so Windows SmartScreen may warn on first run —
> click **More info → Run anyway**, or build it from source yourself.

## Requirements

- Windows 10 (version 2004 / May 2020) or newer, 64-bit.
- **No admin rights, no install, no runtime** — just the `.exe`.
- Footprint: a couple hundred KB; nothing to install or uninstall.

The only change it makes outside its own process is the **optional** "Run at
startup" registry entry, which is easy to undo (see [Removing autostart](#removing-autostart-manually)).

## Usage

Click **Maximum** (finest the system supports, often 0.5 ms), **1 ms**, or
**Default** (release). Tick **Run at Windows startup** to launch on logon. The X
button minimizes to the tray; right-click the tray icon for **Show / Exit**.

## Build

Requires **Visual Studio 2022 Build Tools** (the C++ workload) and **CMake**. Then:

```bat
cmake -S . -B build -A x64
cmake --build build --config Release
```

or just run `build.cmd`.

## Removing autostart manually

```bat
reg delete "HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run" /v TimerRes /f
```
